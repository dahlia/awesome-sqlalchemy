   Versioning and auditing extension for SQLAlchemy.

   - Creates versions for inserts, deletes and updates.
   - Does not store updates which don't change anything.
   - Supports alembic migrations.
   - Can revert objects data as well as all object relations at given
     transaction even if the object was deleted.
   - Transactions can be queried afterwards using SQLAlchemy query syntax.
   - Query for changed records at given transaction.
   - Temporal relationship reflection. Version object's relationship show
     the parent objects relationships as they where in that point in time.
   - Supports native versioning for PostgreSQL database (trigger based
     versioning).

SQLAlchemy-ORM-tree_
   An implementation for SQLAlchemy-based applications of
   the nested-sets/modified-pre-order-tree-traversal technique for
   storing hierarchical data in a relational database.

Forms and Data Validations
--------------------------

ColanderAlchemy_
   ColanderAlchemy helps you to auto-generate Colander_ schemas that are based
   on SQLAlchemy mapped classes.

   Such Colander schemas can be used with libraries like Deform_ and helps
   remove the need for duplication of schema definitions.

FormAlchemy_
   FormAlchemy eliminates boilerplate by autogenerating HTML input fields from a
   given model. FormAlchemy will try to figure out what kind of HTML code should
   be returned by introspecting the model's properties and generate ready-to-use
   HTML code that will fit the developer's application.

WTForms-Alchemy_
   WTForms-Alchemy is a WTForms_ extension toolkit for easier creation of
   model based forms.  Strongly influenced by Django ModelForm.

Full-text Searching
-------------------

SQLAlchemy-Searchable_
   Full-text searchable models for SQLAlchemy. Only supports PostgreSQL.

GIS and Spatial Databases
-------------------------

GeoAlchemy_
   GeoAlchemy provides extensions to SQLAlchemy to work with spatial databases.

   The current supported spatial database systems are PostGIS_, Spatialite_,
   MySQL, Oracle, and MS SQL Server 2008.

`GeoAlchemy 2`_
   GeoAlchemy 2 provides extensions to SQLAlchemy for working with
   spatial databases.

   GeoAlchemy 2 focuses on PostGIS_.  PostGIS 1.5 and PostGIS 2 are supported.

   GeoAlchemy 2 aims to be simpler than its predecessor, GeoAlchemy_.
   Simpler to use, and simpler to maintain.

Internationalizations
---------------------

SQLAlchemy-i18n_
   Internationalization extension for SQLAlchemy models.


   - Stores translations in separate tables.
   - Reflects translation table structures based on
     parent model table structure.
   - Supports forcing of given locale.
   - Good performance (uses proxy dicts and other advanced SQLAlchemy
