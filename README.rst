Data Structures
---------------

   Versioning and auditing extension for SQLAlchemy.

   - Creates versions for inserts, deletes and updates.

   - Supports alembic migrations.
   - Can revert objects data as well as all object relations at given
     transaction even if the object was deleted.
   - Transactions can be queried afterwards using SQLAlchemy query syntax.
   - Query for changed records at given transaction.
   - Temporal relationship reflection. Version object's relationship show
     the parent objects relationships as they where in that point in time.
   - Supports native versioning for PostgreSQL database (trigger based
     versioning).
